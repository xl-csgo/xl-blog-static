      <description>&lt;p&gt;In 2020, I participated in an online cryptic hunt and won a free domain name as a prize. And after spending months unable to decide what to put on here, I eventually just downloaded a template from &lt;a href=&#34;https://html5up.net&#34;&gt;HTML5UP&lt;/a&gt;, and created a blog. With the end of the pandemic nowhere in sight, many—including myself—had turned to gaming as their means of escape.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;And Counter-Strike, a game I essentially stumbled onto thanks to a single session at the local LAN cafe years ago, became my playground of choice. So, as my understanding of the game&amp;rsquo;s history developed through countless hours spent pouring through Liquipedia pages, Thorin videos, and WarOwl match breakdowns, I decided to use this blog as a way to combine my &amp;ldquo;creative writing&amp;rdquo; chops with my burgeoning passion for this video game.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
